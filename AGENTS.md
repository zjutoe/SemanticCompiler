# CapKnow Agent Guidelines

## Core Principles

- KISS and YAGNI: prefer minimal, explicit implementations; avoid over-engineering and defensive programming unless required by explicit protocol.

## Version Control and Provenance

- Git is the source of truth for versioned source, documentation, tests, scripts, and configurations. Do not maintain parallel source-package hashes.
- Create one branch per milestone from a clean `main`. Commit each task stage, review repair, and accepted report on that branch.
- Freeze reviews to an exact commit SHA or commit range, never a branch name. Do not rewrite reviewed history; record fixes as new commits.
- Run formal experiments only from a clean, committed worktree. Record the exact source commit in every experiment manifest.
- After final acceptance, merge the milestone branch into `main` while preserving its review and repair history.
- Use checksums only for evidence outside Git, such as external datasets, uncommitted fixed splits, model weights, and experiment artifacts. A checksum proves byte identity, not validity.
- Any untracked or ignored input that can affect an experiment must be committed or explicitly bound in its manifest by path and checksum.

## Experiment Execution

- Run experiments in the risk order frozen by `main`, using narrow parameterized scripts under `scripts/`.
- Bind the exact source commit, launcher path, configuration, and fixed output roots in the operator handoff.
- Do not continuously read stdout. Send long-task output to job logs and inspect small `status.json`, `progress.json`, `DONE.json`, `FAILED.json`, and experiment `summary.json` files at bounded intervals.
- Preserve manifests, fixed splits, seed provenance, and checksums for evidence outside Git.
- Return failed or scientifically suspicious runs to `main`; `operator` must not patch code or silently alter protocol.

## Progressive Stage Handoffs

- Generate concrete stage handoffs just in time. Only the next executable stage may have a checked-in handoff; do not batch-generate handoff documents for downstream stages.
- A roadmap may name later stages, dependencies, and coarse objectives, but it must not pre-freeze their mutation paths, acceptance details, or executable instructions before predecessor work is accepted.
- Create the successor handoff only after the predecessor's exact commit or range is independently reviewed and accepted, all review repairs are committed, and unexpected implementation findings have been incorporated into the governing plan or fixtures.
- If execution reveals an unanticipated contract, interface, or scope issue, stop the stage and return it to `main`. Repair and review the governing contract first; do not continue from a stale handoff or draft future handoffs around the issue.
- Bind each newly generated handoff to the then-current accepted source commit and actual predecessor artifacts. A previously drafted or superseded handoff grants no mutation authority.
- Generate an optional-stage handoff only after its prerequisites are accepted and the user has explicitly authorized the optional scope, external access, cost, and side effects that it requires.

## Research Review and Acceptance

- High-risk changes include simulators, observation semantics, task distributions, train/calibration/evaluation splits, metrics, statistical aggregation, acceptance logic, and result interpretation.
- Any high-risk change must trigger an independent review agent using the same model family as the main thread, with no shared context between the review agent and main thread.
- Before accepting non-trivial changes, freeze them in a commit and spawn an independent strict read-only review agent by default with `fork_context=false`.
- The review handoff should include only: intended diff, relevant artifacts, acceptance criteria, protocol constraints, and verification already run.
- For each high-risk change handoff, include: exact commit or range, concise change summary, reproducible commands, key touched files, verification outputs, and relevant artifact checksums.
- Review protocol/implementation consistency, leakage, objective/inference consistency, statistical independence, clustered aggregation, metric semantics, acceptance logic, artifact provenance, and theoretical overclaiming.
- Bind exact artifact checksums before reviewing or accepting experiment outputs that may later support a scientific claim.
- `main` accepts or rejects each frozen implementation or research package only after independent agent review.
- After code changes, run relevant targeted tests first; escalate to repository-wide tests and static checks based on risk, failures, or scope changes.
- Never use ignored artifacts from superseded or methodologically invalid runs in final conclusions.

## Verification and Checksum Policy

- Verification must be proportional to risk. Prefer targeted tests and direct semantic checks for ordinary code changes.
- Use the Git commit to bind versioned inputs. Use checksums only where Git does not bind the evidence.
- Do not trigger scientific revalidation for comments, formatting, EOF whitespace, or other non-semantic edits. Revalidate when experiment semantics or accepted evidence change.
- Checksums support reproducibility and tamper detection; they never replace review, tests, or scientific judgment.
- A mechanical cleanup should not cascade into benchmark permission changes, scientific reinterpretation, or SOL audit unless it changes the milestone boundary or the accepted scientific evidence package.
